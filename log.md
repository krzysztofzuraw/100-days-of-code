## Day 1: December 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started implementing header for TM conf static site; started working on quicksort

**Thoughts:** It's funny to see how I struggle with design and CSS - I clearly see that it will take
time. I played myself this [video](https://vimeo.com/85040589). I need to find way to be better at designing.

## Day 2: December 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Implemented custom button in header for TM conf static site; have working
pseudocode for quicksort partition. Created blog post about 100 days challenge.

**Thoughts:** I've made a progress! I have my header looking a little bit better than yesterday. I
also made my partition logic in quicksort working.
